# snake_game

For now, it is just an experiment with various kinds of snake mechanics. But, in the future, it can evolve into either a challenging skill based small game or a snake rpg or a snake dungeon crawler.

## Build and Run Process

- make sure you have make and g++
- run the following commands

    ```shell
    
    make all
    ./snake
    ```
